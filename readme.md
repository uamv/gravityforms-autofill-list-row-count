Gravity Forms: Autofill List Row Count
==============================

Gravity Forms: Autofill List Row Count extends the Gravity Forms WordPress plugin by adding an option for autofilling the number of rows in a list to another field (number, single product, or quantity) within a Gravity Form.

This repository is a development version intended to facilitate communication with developers. I will aim to keep it stable, but use at your own discretion. Pull requests are welcome.

## Usage Instructions
After installing and activating this plugin, you will find an additional option under the *Advanced* editing tab for fields of type number, product, and quantity. This field is labeled **Sync Field Value**. Insert the field ID of a *List Field* on the form. When the number of rows is modified in the list, the value of this field will be autoupdated to match the number of rows.
